## Temperature Controller With TM4C123G microcontroller



This report and codes encapsulates the development and implementation of a temperature control
system leveraging the TM4C123G microcontroller. The project's core aim involves integrating
diverse hardware components, including the BMP280 sensor, Nokia 5110 LCD, resistive heating
pad, and peltier, to create a functional temperature control mechanism.
The primary objectives revolve around continuous temperature monitoring within a specified
environment, maintaining it within adjusted limits, and presenting real-time data through
various output interfaces. Maintaining the environment’s temperature within adjusted limits
will be provided with peltier and resistive heating pad. Achieving this necessitates adeptness
in hardware-software coordination, adhering to specific restrictions in both hardware
utilization and programming languages.
This project serves as an exercise in fusing theoretical knowledge with hands-on application,
emphasizing the significance of careful design and seamless integration of different hardware
elements to craft a cohesive temperature control system.
The next sections elucidate the methodologies, challenges, and outcomes encountered during
development, highlighting the strategies employed to fulfill project requisites within stipulated
constraints. Furthermore, it explores the use of Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and I2C for
efficient device communication, underscoring the proficiency in microcontroller-based system
